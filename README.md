## Statistics
Contains IPython notebooks related to visualization and analysis of data from Statistics 1 course at the American University of Paris taught by Pierre Bienvenu. Problems and data generally come from the textbook [Stats, Data, and Models.](https://acwang.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/stats-data-and-models-3rd-edition-richard-d-de-veaux.pdf)

Notebooks generally contain tips, tricks, tools, and code which I used to answer questions assigned as homework problems. The course utilizes DataDesk, however I prefer Python when given the option due to its flexability and my famiiliarity with it and its libraries.
